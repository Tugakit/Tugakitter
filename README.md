What is this project about ?
This project is a clone of Twitter made with Reack.JS and TailwindCSS.

The main goal of this project is to learn how to use TailwindCSS and Reack.JS, and master the concepts of the framework, asi never used both of them, and as Twitter made Bootstrap(That i already used), it gives me a great challenge to overcome.

If you're interested to follow the development of this project, you can follow me on Twitter [@Tugakit](https://twitter.com/Tugakit).
